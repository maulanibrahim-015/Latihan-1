            </h4>
            At the Awesome science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as as long as the sybjects fall 
            <br/>somewhare in the realm of science and the technology. you seem like an intelligent, dedicated resercher, and just 
            <br/>the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. sayying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued
            <br/>by are as follow, in order of priority: 

            <ol>
                <li>
                  Turning 
                  <sup>H</sup>

                    Measuring the effect on the perfomance of fung bassplayers at temparatures exceeding 30<sup>0</sup>C (86<sup>0</sup>F)
                    <br/>audiance size exponentially increases ( effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>).
                </li>
                
                <li>

            </ol>
            so please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the

                Exotic dance moves
            </h4>
            Yes, you are right! As part my post-doctorate work. 1 <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. to answer your questions 
            <br/> my favorite  dances are as follows, with definitions.
            
            <dl>
            <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt> 
                <dd>A litle known but <i>very</i> inffulential dance dating back back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around
                <br/>in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestoc to be "fruitful".</dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
            <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
               <dd> Before the calenders devoloped fire as a mean of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which 
                <br/>involved hudlling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly
                <br/>they, very rapid movements. on of my follow students used to say that he thouught this dance inspired
                <br/>modern styles such us twerking. </dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
            <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
                <dd>An interesting example of historic misin formation, English explorers in the 1960<sub>s</sub> belived to have
                <br/>to have discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic" ,stilted movements, being precticed by inhabitants
                <br/>of Nothern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this
                <br/>because they were really cold.</dd>
            </dl>
